# Plan: Add Database Restore Instructions to README

## Summary
Add instructions to the README for restoring the database from an SQL dump available at `https://xyz.com/db-dump-three-graphs.sql`.

## Files to Modify
- `README.md` (lines 60-77, Setup section)

## Implementation

### Edit README.md

Insert a new step **3.5** (renumbering step 4 to step 5) in the Setup section, between "Configure environment variables" and "Run the application":

**New Step 4: Set up the database**

```markdown
4. **Set up the database**:

   Create a PostgreSQL database and restore the knowledge graph data:

   ```bash
   # Create the database
   createdb ark_knowledge_graphs

   # Download and restore the SQL dump
   curl -o db-dump.sql https://xyz.com/db-dump-three-graphs.sql
   psql ark_knowledge_graphs < db-dump.sql
   ```

   Make sure your `POSTGRES_URL` in `.env` matches the database name you created.
```

**Renumber**: Current step 4 ("Run the application") becomes step 5.

## Verification
1. Read the modified README and verify the new step is correctly placed
2. Confirm step numbering is sequential (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
3. Run `pnpm check-types` to ensure no build issues (unlikely for markdown changes, but good practice)
